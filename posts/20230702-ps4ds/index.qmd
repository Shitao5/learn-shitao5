# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Elements of Structured Data

- In fact, a major challenge of data science is to harness this torrent of raw data into actionable information.

## Estimates of Location

- METRICS AND ESTIMATES  
Statisticians often use the term *estimate* for a value calculated from the data at hand, to draw a distinction between what we see from the data and the theoretical true or exact state of affairs. Data scientists and business analysts are more likely to refer to such a value as a *metric*. The difference reflects the approach of statistics versus that of data science: accounting for uncertainty lies at the heart of the discipline of statistics, whereas concrete business or organizational objectives are the focus of data science. Hence, **statisticians estimate, and data scientists measure**.

- Still, outliers are often the result of data errors such as mixing data of different units (kilometers versus meters) or bad readings from a sensor. When outliers are the result of bad data, the mean will result in a poor estimate of location, while the median will still be valid. In any case, outliers should be identified and are usually worthy of further investigation.
